shame,Two years back someone invited me to be the tutor of her grand-daughter. The grand-daughter asked me some questions in mathematics so I taught her. However she did not listen to me and this made me feel unhappy. The second year it was the same. When I entered university the girl's parents suggested that I be employed as their daghters tutor. They told me that at university there was no homework and I would have a lot of time so they made a time-table for me which required me to be the tutor five days a week. They did not respect me and anyway I had another child to teach. ,sadness,sadness,sadness,sadness,"[0.87537736, 0.79041237, 0.75894237, 0.6410286, 0.031022497, 0.9691064, 0.7101712]","[0.98397857, 0.9764257, 0.9341634, 0.94515, 0.07136883, 0.9908289, 0.97683936]","[0.99107236, 0.88598686, 0.7520407, 0.9495095, 0.0033977018, 0.9954491, 0.93009347]","[0.88949865, 0.77902716, 0.687498, 0.5182401, 0.006488983, 0.9938775, 0.6079281]",sadness
