joy,"In August,, the long awaited ""big envelope"" (a document for C. U. H. K admission) arrived. It was in the afternoon and I had not been doing anything. When the postman, with his big bag, knocked on the door I knew what it was about. I hurriedly opened the envelope and my mood at that time is hard to describe. It lasted several hours and only calmed down later. ",anger,"[0.9613422, 0.75882816, 0.9066401, 0.9605928, 0.004868826, 0.92923576, 0.917831]",0.9613422

Even if I failed this subject I would not need to repeat. However I liked this subject very much and my results were bad because of my lazyness. If I was forced to change to a minor in this subject I would be very unwilling. ",fear,"[0.45570788, 0.5248318, 0.99885035, 0.9813679, 0.0010954159, 0.94597805, 0.96860784]",0.99885035

When he learnt that I had got marks in a test he told me "" A failure, You lost marks. "" I was very angry, not because my marks were lower than his, but because I could not tolerate his pride. I did not show my discontentment and carried on doing my work. ",anger,"[0.99531484, 0.9368739, 0.8725788, 0.8549298, 0.0013639657, 0.79633623, 0.9005509]",0.99531484
fear,This issue worried me rather than saddening me. In mid September I went to Guanggho alone. I was looking for an accomodation in the evening and after having walked or miles I still could not find anything. What could I do?

I finally found a place to sleep at o'clock. ,fear,"[0.15710689, 0.114482336, 0.9780577, 0.3979117, 0.0028106086, 0.08867996, 0.28500864]",0.9780577

shame,Two years back someone invited me to be the tutor of her grand-daughter. The grand-daughter asked me some questions in mathematics so I taught her.

They told me that at university there was no homework and I would have a lot of time so they made a time-table for me which required me to be the tutor five days a week.
