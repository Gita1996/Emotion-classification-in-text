shame,Two years back someone invited me to be the tutor of her grand-daughter. The grand-daughter asked me some questions in mathematics so I taught her. However she did not listen to me and this made me feel unhappy. The second year it was the same. When I entered university the girl's parents suggested that I be employed as their daghters tutor. They told me that at university there was no homework and I would have a lot of time so they made a time-table for me which required me to be the tutor five days a week. They did not respect me and anyway I had another child to teach. ,sadness,sadness,sadness,sadness,"[0.38582212, 0.32035053, 0.26126233, 0.1626067, 0.014655141, 0.47133425, 0.13240087]","[0.8675584, 0.9016778, 0.12026683, 0.5454556, 0.0036817924, 0.9497338, 0.58664024]","[0.9191737, 0.5120723, 0.4628349, 0.048560247, 0.0063310424, 0.9802265, 0.20843704]","[0.43357348, 0.5572901, 0.053967096, 0.28007528, 0.00215407, 0.84834075, 0.21719044]",sadness
