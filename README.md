I found some datasets including the texts and their emotions (such as joy, angry, etc) and did some preprocessing. I used some NLP models (Bert based models such as Deberta, Roberta, Bart) to find the emotion for each text that has highest entailment probability regarding relevance to the text as predicted emotion (zero shot classification). I also used different description of emotions by adding templates at the beginning of emotion as the representation of emotion which is called prompt and compared the results of using different prompts and using only emotion (Regarding Macro average F1 for the whole dataset and each emotion label). I also analyzed the results to understand how adding templates affects emotion classification by comparing the attention of tokens of the sentence (concatenation of main sentence and prompts) regarding the emotion was improved when the prompt was used.  I also combined the results of prompts by averaging the entailment probabilities that are resulted from using different prompts and selected the highest one as the predicted label. We can see that the ensemble method has the performance equal to the best individual prompt result.
