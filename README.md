I found some datasets including the texts and their emotions (such as joy, angry, etc) and did some preprocessing. I used some NLP models (Bert based models) to find the emotion for each text that has highest entailment probability regarding relevance to the text as predicted emotion (zero shot classification). I also used different description of emotions by adding templates at the beginning of emotion as the representation of emotion which is called prompt and compared the results of prompts. I fine-tune models on the train sets and did prediction on test sets as non zero shot classification to compare it with zero shot classification.
