I found some datasets including the texts and their emotions (such as joy, angry, etc.) and did some preprocessing. I used some NLP models (Bert based models such as Deberta, Roberta, Bart) to check the entailment of the text and emotions and find the emotion for each text that has highest entailment probability regarding relevance to the text as predicted emotion (zero shot classification). I also used different description of emotions by adding templates at the beginning of emotion as the representation of emotion which is called prompt and compared the results of using different prompts and using only emotion (Regarding Macro average F1 for the whole dataset and emotion labels). I also analyzed the results to understand how adding templates affects emotion classification by comparing the average of attention scores of tokens of the sentence (concatenation of main sentence and prompts) regarding their relevance to the emotions for the cases that using prompt colud lead to improvements to them.  I also combined the results of prompts by averaging the entailment probabilities that are resulted from using different prompts and selected the emotion that has the highest average of the entailment probabilities as the predicted label. We can see that the ensemble method has the performance equal to the best individual prompt result.
