Next morning, o'clock, a female classmate knocked on our door and tried to wake us up. I was not fully conscious and I said something which I should not have. I realized the trouble I had made and wanted to hide. Later I said sorry to her and the matter came to an end.

shame,Two years back someone invited me to be the tutor of her grand-daughter. The grand-daughter asked me some questions in mathematics so I taught her. However she did not listen to me and this made me feel unhappy. The second year it was the same. When I entered university the girl's parents suggested that I be employed as their daghters tutor. They told me that at university there was no homework and I would have a lot of time so they made a time-table for me which required me to be the tutor five days a week. They did not respect me and anyway I had another child to teach. ,sadness,"[0.8675584, 0.9016778, 0.12026683, 0.5454556, 0.0036817924, 0.9497338, 0.58664024]",0.9497338
